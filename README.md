set.

## Current direction / to-do list:
Planing on packaging this installation with a 'setup.py'
file instead of having to run 'python main.py' everytime.

Planning on adding another lyrics site here incase lyrics
cannot be found on www.azlyrics.com

Also, I am currently working on an ncurses version of this
lyrics grabbing
